<span class="close">&times;</span><br>
    <p>I remember the time when my mom first introduced me into the world of cooking and it was all unintentional. I was a geeky 10 year old waiting for my turn to watch the TV when she changed the channel to Sanjeev Kapoor’s Khaana Khazana. I was intrigued. For the first time ever, something on the TV was making me salivate. Seated beside me was a lady who prepared sultry dishes each morning and toiled herself until late in the night yet many times I failed to appreciate her efforts. Now a trained chef with moustache as good as my dad’s was cooking up his sleeve and finding his way invariably into the kitchens of India. </p><p>
Circa 2009. Masterchef Australia created waves across the globe with its theme and never before seen reality show concept. Participants across all races working against time to create a handcrafted, saliva inducing dish~ the result was that the show found huge fans across all the nations, some of which (even my nation) tried to replicate it but failed. Nevertheless, the waves which had created uncharted energy seemingly also led to rise another uncharted territory; that of a micro food blogger. Instagram was a fast moving photo sharing application which was gaining fandom like no one and in meantime, the fad turn to ‘bright, instagrammable food dishes that not only invoked visual appeal but also pleasure senses.</p><p>
Fast forward to 2017. I had already marked my level up Zomato- a fun platform to share reviews and photos and restaurants had started to invite me on bloggers table and personal review invites. In April 2017, my friend and now partner in the page, Shreyans took me into confidence to start an Instagram page (yea, I was one of those guys who never had a personal account on Instagram!). My immediate question was ‘There are dozens doing it. What’s the use?’ and came a very polished and fabricated answer ‘Let’s take a step’. Knowingly that we had to stand out from crowd, we plunged into micro blogging and our page “The Munchy Brisk” was live. Eight months down the line, we may not have crossed a certain amount of followers, but have covered 70+ food outlets, met a dozen of people in Mumbai and Pune and grew so very close to them. Two days back, I also wrote my 200th review. </p><p>
So if I remind myself of April 2017 and recollect the exact same question while writing this- ‘There are dozens doing it. What’s the use?” I have realized my potential creativity and a sense of leadership and team membership. I call up my partner more than I call my parents. We brainstorm, interact, question each other and sometimes even ask each other. Our photographs maybe quite average for some, quite outstanding for some but for us it’s just where it has to be: satisfied. We have developed a unique set pattern for our The Munchy Brisk: 1. there will be weekly series twice a month. 2. A monthly series each every two or three months. We started with our monthly series “Behind the scene” which showcases the life of blogger from his/her childhood until now. It was a huge success with many finding the true story and getting inspired. It will end this Sunday. Our weekly series ‘Beach Food’ was also a great success and the reach crossed our expectations. Currently, as I write, we are working round the clock for our second monthly series ‘Foodnomics’ where we talk about the economics behind food and are drafting our third monthly series. By the side, we are ready to collaborate with other brands and are also collaborating with other food bloggers for ‘Food Crawls’. </p><p>
Did we stand out? YES. As per one of the fellow bloggers who has a very good reach appreciated and acknowledged that we are one of the few micro bloggers engaging in a very new format and food blogging required a different perspective.  One of the person I look up to is Himanshu (My Yellow plate), who travels across the length and breadth of the globe and eats on his yellow plate ~ A classic case of simple content and executing it just wonderfully. Curating content is an art. Observe, learn, talk and repeat. That’s how the world of micro blogging works. Above all maintain relations. Food Blogging is the one of the last remaining genuine platform wherein you will talk; grow close to people of all ages- right from 20 to 40 to 60! I hang out with people who are highly qualified and assume high positions in their respective field yet I feel just so at ease with them. Also do take note that humour without any personal remark is always appreciated. Comments like ‘Yummy’, ‘Nice picture’ are balmy. Play with words, the colours or the picture itself. Being creative is not art; it’s a deed which only few recognize. Food blogging is not about the invites you get; it’s about how crafty you can get and manage to coat your viewers with an appetizing content! </p><br>
