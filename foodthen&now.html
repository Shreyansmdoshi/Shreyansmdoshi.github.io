As the dawn settles and scores of passengers start alighting from packed trains, the vendors outside Elphinstone and Lower Parel Stations are in for a treat. Within 5 minutes, each of the vendor’s stalls will be brimming with a queue to eat a humble plate of Medu Vada and Idli along with ice cold chutney and protein rich sambar. White collar and blue collar workers could be seen happily gorging on this delicious stream of hot food which will certainly make a good beginning for the rest of the day. <br>
“Roughly fifteen years back, we would only see the lower class workers eating over here. I would sell the items at Rs. 5 and Rs. 10 and earn about around Rs. 500 per day. Now, my items have also expanded and prices go uptil Rs. 50 and I am happy earning Rs. 3000. The big difference now is that these new people, who come in their shirt, tie and shiny shoes, appreciate the effort and taste. Many a times, they even take parcel for their colleagues. In the early years, with low wage workers, it wasn’t the case. They ate to suffice. The new generation eats to live.’ remarks a vendor. 
The simple Vada pav; a spiced potato patty, batter coated and deep fried, stuffed between a fluffy local bread also called as a pav and smothered with chutney, is a snack which the city and its citizens swear by. Available from Rs. 10, this iconic item has also undergone change like the mills which paved way for commercialization. One of the pioneers in spearheading molecular gastronomy for Indian cuisine has its own take on Vada pav. A restaurant with effervescent people all around, the Vada takes a form of smooth potato and cheese mousse, served warm along with a mini local pav. What sets the tongue tickling though is the surprise element: spiced dry garlic chutney served in edible potato starch pouches. Street food with a touch of gourmet and showbiz! The city which doesn’t sleep is also a city which will continue to surprise you in every way possible. 
You pass by the lanes of Fort and the whiff of freshly baked buns tempts you take a brisk walk towards the café. Soon you realize you are in the mecca of eating breakfast. A group of elderly is sticking to their chai, a couple romancing over bun maska jam and a family dining with plates of akoori and keema masala. The owner shouting, rather calmly to the waiter for to confirm the order for preparing the final bill and the quick service- a quaint reminder of the city’s oldest surviving cafes. As the new generation readies to take over and spread the long lost culinary delight, we see a new ray of hope as the concepts of Irani cafes takes a centre stage and the corporate structure along with a trained female chef makes it possible to spread the Irani/Parsi delight to the rest of cities. A touch of nostalgia. A touch of Mumbai. <br>
A typical mill worker’s lunch meal now finds its way to gastronomy delights across modern pubs, cafes and lounges. Had it not been for the tired mill workers, who just mashed their vegetable leftovers and ate them along with pav and homemade butter, we wouldn’t possibly dare to make Pav Bhaji our all-time favourite meal. Go up north to the suburbs of Kandivali and Borivali and the eastern suburb of Ghatkopar where a high concentration of eccentric Gujaratis resides, we see restaurants having their twist on Pav Bhaji. The love for Switzerland is not just reflected in movies and Ranveer Singh’s promotional posts but we have taken a slice of their famous Fondue and fused our local delicacy with it- Yes, A Pav Bhaji fondue! A spiced thick curry mixed with cheese (loads of it) and served alongside buttered pav on its special equipment. This dish has found takers in other cities as well and it’s stupendously gratifying how Indians have swiftly adopted to fusion cuisine. Tell a Japanese that we drizzle mayonnaise on their iconic Sushi and they’re surely going to faint! Yet again, sushi is selling in huge numbers because of one single ingredient adapted to local tastes. 
Back in the day, Yacht was not just limited to leisure sailing off the coast and neither Gokul was limited to the holy birth land of Lord Krishna. Mumbaikars relished their quick round of beers, Old Monk and Blender’s Pride along with chakli, peanuts and cheeslings at these restaurants and bars; memories which are still etched across our hearts. Late 2010 and we have seen the birth and revolution of molecular gastronomic drinks. Now we have some high octane drama and a big usage of liquid nitrogen in our drinks- be it Mocktails or cocktails. Muddled fruits, a strong addition of your choice of base alcohol, smoked with exotic herbs and local spices and served in glassware you would want to take home~ the possibilities and combinations are endless and with new gastronomy pubs opening at a every 20 days, Mumbaikars have a lot to rejoice about.<br>
Khoya made into roundels is stuffed with pistachios. Ghee or clarified butter is then heated to the required temperature. The luscious balls of khoya are then deep fried till golden brown and dunked in sugar syrup. Layered with an edible silver leaf, the sweet is intricately soft inside and a tad crisp on the outside. A sea of sweetness fills my nose, making saliva a waterfall of saffron and cashew inside my mouth. Slowly as I chewed ahead, a stream of deliciousness touched my tongue. As my teeth sunk more into it, a series of absolute smoothness was felt inside my body. Gulab Jamun is a culinary delight found across roadside stalls for as cheap as Rs. 8 and in various sweetshops for as high as Rs. 30 per piece. All thanks to the new Generation of Le Cordon Bleu trained chefs; we have seen the good old sweet making a grand debut on the international stage. Now we have Gulab Jamun cheesecakes, Gulab Rabdi Tarts, chocolate stuffed Gulab Jamun amongst the notable variations. Not only has Gulab Jamun been given the global stage to fuse itself with delicacies of other cuisines, but other traditional Indian sweet and desserts have also found their calling for the chefs. Paan Cheesecake, Motichur Ice cream, Rasmalai Très Leches and the list just continues to expand. <br>
With the advent of rising national income and a never ending thirst for innovation, the future is outshined with more possibilities yet each action has an equal and opposite reaction. The food has become main-stream with now even small businesses giving a tough competition to big bulls of the industry. Businesses cannot be built around trends. A long-term outlook with short-term, hands-on approach is required. Safety concerns and checks also have to be in place as India races to becoming the most populous country by 2022. It’s already mid-2018 and churros have started to become the next fast, consumable item. 2019 will be knocking our doors soon so should we keep ourselves ready for Paan stuffed croissants? </p><br>
